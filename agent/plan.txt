===== Agent Plan =====

What we wish to do is to create something novel, but not overly complicated. Project should take about a month (end date should plan for is say 15-Feb).

Design an RL agent built upon Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that controls the traffic lights in an intersection. Use a Deep Q Network (DQN) to output a priority score
for each node. The reward function for this agent will primarily consider the number of cars waiting, and the total / relative amount of waiting each car has or will
need to do.

Based on this priority score, we use a precomputed function to determine which traffic phase (which set of lights, for example North-South + South-North) to turn on.
This could be just as simple as adding up all the scores for each light controlled by the phase, but could be more complicated, considering safety, minimum light on
time, etc to make it more realistic (Value Decomposition). This probably should be hardcoded, the agent does not deal with phases, just lights, and has more than enough
to deal with at the moment.

This novel part of this project is the ability to generalise. Currently, "Zero-shot traffic control" is not possible under current research - creating one agent to
rule them all. What we could do instead is: for 95% of the time we train on a bunch of precomputed, possibly randomly predetermined intersections. Once this has been
completed we go on to spend a little bit of time, say 5% or about 100,000+ timesteps on other, specific intersections, possibly ones that the user can generate.
If the target training takes say less than a minute (which it wont) then we could even contruct an app that could let you create an intersection and then play it.

===== Simulation options =====

Not my domain, but these could be options to simplify environment making.... Still lots of stuff like automated intersection generation which would be interesting
